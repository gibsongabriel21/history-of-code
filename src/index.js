<h2><strong>1944 - The Colossus</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The Colossus</strong> was the first large-scale electronic computer.
 The inventor of Colossus was <em>Tommy Flowers</em>. He had been tasked with designing
 a machine that would help decode “enigma”, the german code that was used during
 World War 2.  Although current devices were able to decipher the enigma,
 it was at a very slow rate that could take weeks at a time.
 The Colossus accomplished this task via valves that would allow it to go
 through codes in a much shorter amount of time than any human.
 The idea was met with skepticism, but was eventually approved and
 the machine was able to go through 5000 characters in a single second.
 The Colossus was able to bring decoding that would ordinarily take weeks down
 to only a few hours. The Colossus proved itself instrumental in ending
 World War II, as it allowed the allied powers to learn about strategies,
 numbers, and various other information which allowed them to overwhelm the
 German armies. The Colossus was one of the first electric computers that would
 eventually lead to further innovations in coding."</p>

<h2>1948 - Manchester “Baby”</h2>
<p>After the colossus, further advancements were made in computer science.
 <em>Tom Kilburn</em> and <em>Frederic Williams</em> created one of  the first storage systems,
 known as a “Williams Tube” which stored Cathode rays. After constructing
 a small computer known as the <strong>Small Scale Experimental Machine</strong>, or <strong>“Baby”</strong>,
 it was able to run this program and operated as the first working stored
 program computer. Magnetic drums were also used as an outside holder of memory,
 which can be seen as an inspiration for other external hard drives such as USB
 ports and similar storage devices which wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for this
 invention. It was the first program to actually be run on a computer.</p>

<h2>1974 - Xerox PARC Alto</h2>
<p>The <strong>Xerox Alto</strong> marked a significant change in how people were able
 to interact with computers. Up until this point, computers had to be communicated
 with via text, as graphics were too complicated. The xerox changed this with
 the mouse cursor, which made it significantly easier to run and interact with
 programs on the computer. The mouse was much easier to use than the text-based
 systems of the past, and allowed windows and icons to be moved easily.
 This early computer went on to influence the Macintosh and other PCs which
 went on to become much larger products.</p>
